3) Feedback
This was our first time using BigQuery AI and Google Cloud.  

- Positive: Even without prior experience, the functions were approachable. We were able to get results quickly using SQL and the integration with Vertex AI felt natural.  
- Friction points: Because we were new, it took time to understand which functions (e.g., ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING, VECTOR_SEARCH) were available in which regions. Error messages could be clearer for beginners. Documentation is solid, but more multimodal examples would help first-time users.  
Overall, BigQuery AI lowered the barrier for newcomers. We could build a working multimodal system in just a few days, which shows the platform is powerful and beginner-friendly.
